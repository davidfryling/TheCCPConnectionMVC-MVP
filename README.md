# Introduction 
This web application aims to solve a real-world problem facing partnering high schools and colleges in central Ohio. The current process for high school students signing up for college classes is composed of many pieces of paper and what seems like an endless stream of emails. The process is confusing, fragmented, and riddled with failure points. The CCP Connection will connect all of the stakeholders via a single online portal that manages the entire course request process, from start to finish.
